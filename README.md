# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview

This project includes an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Instructions

The structure is quite simple, the code is included in the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. The markup can be found inside the `index.html`file and layout in the `style.css` file.

## Additional Info

For sake of simplicity and the API structure, the weather is fetched for United States, hence for testing you can use of the following postcodes (or any valid US zip code) and valid results should be returned:

- 22313
- 30040
- 45040
- 11220
